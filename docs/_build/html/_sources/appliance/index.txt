Server Appliance
================

FMF does not compromise on using the latest server technologies and platforms.  As such, FMF has many dependencies, some of which are hard to install and configure.  

A VirtualBox appliance has been created which bundles all of the dependencies into one file.  This document will show you how to install your own local server appliance so you can quickly begin developing websites on this advanced platform.


Installing VirtualBox
+++++++++++++++++++++

If you are not familiar with Virtualization, it is basically a way to run one or more operating systems inside another.  In our case, we are using the free and Virtualization "Hypervisor" VirtualBox which is now owned by Oracle.

To download VirtualBox for any platform, `go to this link<https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>`_. 

Once downloaded, follow the installation steps for your platform, it is easy to install.


Obtaining the Appliance
+++++++++++++++++++++++

To run the FMF server, you will need to download and import the server appliance.  You can `download it here<http://virtuecenter-fmf.s3.amazonaws.com/fmf.ova>`_.  It is a large file, a little over 1GB.


Using the Appliance
+++++++++++++++++++

Using the appliance is a simple as importing it in VirtualBox and clicking the start button.  A window will pop-up and your web server will be running.

The first time you run it, it may ask you to update the network settings.  Make sure you are using "Bridged" networking, and choose your network adapter.  The virtual server will obtain a new IP from your router.  


Share Drive
+++++++++++

If you are using Windows, you should automatically see a new shared drive appear named FMF.  This shared directory maps the /var/www folder to an accessible folder for you to work on in your local drive.  Putting a folder in this directory makes it accessible to your web server.
