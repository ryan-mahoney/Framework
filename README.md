# Virtue Center Framework 

## RESTful, Event-Driven, NoSQL PHP Framework... based on many micro-components.

This framework is based on Slim and is installed via Composer.  Requires PHP 5.4.

PHP Module Dependencies:
mbstring, memcache, mongo, openssl

Philosophically, this framework aims to use the latest PHP technology for high-speed execution, but a design that is extremely modular and minimal while achieving maximum unit-testability.

to install:

```bash
wget https://raw.github.com/virtuecenter/framework/master/new.sh -v -O new.sh && ./new.sh projectFolderName; rm -rf new.sh
```
